### Key Characteristics:
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration**: 90-120 minutes
- üíª **Format**: Live coding on your machine or shared screen
- üéØ **Goal**: Build a functional application with clean code
- üìù **Evaluation**: Code quality, design patterns, working demo
- üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**: Any IDE, any programming language (usually Java/Python/JavaScript)

### Companies that Conduct Machine Coding:
- **Flipkart** (Most common)
- **Amazon**
- **Uber**
- **Swiggy**
- **Walmart**
- **Atlassian**
- **PhonePe**
- **Razorpay**
- **Dream11**
- **BookMyShow**

---

## üß≠ 2. How to Approach Machine Coding Problems

### **Phase 1: Understanding Requirements (5-10 minutes)**

#### Step 1: Read the Problem Carefully
- Read the entire problem statement twice
- Highlight key requirements
- Note down constraints and edge cases

#### Step 2: Ask Clarifying Questions
**Always ask these questions:**

1. **"What are the core features I MUST implement?"**
   - Helps you prioritize what's essential

2. **"Should I handle authentication/authorization?"**
   - Usually NO for machine coding

3. **"Do you need a database or in-memory storage is fine?"**
   - Most times in-memory is acceptable

4. **"Should I write test cases?"**
   - Depends on company, but focus on working code first

5. **"Can I use any external libraries?"**
   - Clarify if you can use frameworks like Spring Boot, Express, etc.

6. **"Should I implement a UI or CLI is fine?"**
   - Most companies accept CLI/console applications

7. **"What's more important: working demo or perfect code?"**
   - Usually working demo with decent code wins

#### Step 3: Confirm Scope
List out features and confirm with interviewer:
- ‚úÖ "I'll implement features X, Y, Z"
- ‚ùå "I won't implement features A, B as they're nice-to-have"

---

### **Phase 2: Design (10-15 minutes)**

#### Step 1: Identify Core Entities
Example for **Parking Lot**:
- ParkingLot
- ParkingSpot
- Vehicle (Car, Bike, Truck)
- Ticket
- Payment

#### Step 2: Draw Class Diagram (on paper or whiteboard)
Example:
  ParkingLot
  - spots
  - tickets
  + parkVehicle()
  + removeVehicle()
       |
       | has many
       v
  ParkingSpot
  - id
  - type
  - isOccupied

#### Step 3: Identify Design Patterns Needed
- **Singleton**: For managers (ParkingLotManager)
- **Factory**: For creating different vehicle types
- **Strategy**: For different pricing strategies
- **Observer**: For notifications

#### Step 4: Define Interfaces First
Write method signatures:
\`\`\`java
interface ParkingStrategy {
    ParkingSpot findSpot(VehicleType type);
}

interface PricingStrategy {
    double calculatePrice(Ticket ticket);
}
\`\`\`

---

### **Phase 3: Implementation (60-80 minutes)**

#### Step 1: Create Basic Structure (10 minutes)
- Create all classes and interfaces
- Add basic fields and constructors
- No logic yet, just skeleton

#### Step 2: Implement Core Functionality (40 minutes)
- Start with simplest feature
- Test it works before moving to next
- Keep running the code frequently

#### Step 3: Add Business Logic (20 minutes)
- Validations
- Error handling
- Edge cases

#### Step 4: Add Features in Priority Order
**Priority 1 (MUST HAVE):**
- Core functionality that makes the system work

**Priority 2 (SHOULD HAVE):**
- Important but not critical features

**Priority 3 (NICE TO HAVE):**
- Additional features if time permits

---

### **Phase 4: Testing & Demo (10-15 minutes)**

#### Step 1: Write Main Method / Test Cases
\`\`\`java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Test Case 1: Park a car
    ParkingLot lot = ParkingLot.getInstance();
    Vehicle car = new Car("KA-01-1234");
    Ticket ticket = lot.parkVehicle(car);
    System.out.println("Ticket: " + ticket.getId());

    // Test Case 2: Remove vehicle and pay
    double amount = lot.removeVehicle(ticket.getId());
    System.out.println("Amount: " + amount);
}
\`\`\`

#### Step 2: Test Edge Cases
- Empty parking lot
- Full parking lot
- Invalid inputs
- Null checks

#### Step 3: Prepare for Demo
- Clean up console output
- Add meaningful print statements
- Be ready to explain your code

## ‚è∞ 4. Time Management Strategy

### **The 90-Minute Breakdown:**

  0-10 min:  Requirements & Questions
 10-20 min:  Design & Class Diagram
 20-30 min:  Basic Structure + Skeleton
 30-60 min:  Core Implementation
 60-75 min:  Additional Features
 75-85 min:  Testing & Bug Fixes
 85-90 min:  Demo Preparation

### **Time Management Tips:**

1. **Set Milestones:**
   - ‚úÖ By 30 min: Structure ready
   - ‚úÖ By 60 min: Core working
   - ‚úÖ By 80 min: All features done
   - ‚úÖ By 90 min: Demo ready

2. **Use Timer:**
   - Set alarms at 30, 60, 80 minutes
   - Check progress at each alarm
   - Adjust priorities if behind

3. **Don't Get Stuck:**
   - If stuck for 5+ minutes, move on
   - Come back later if time permits
   - Working partial solution > incomplete perfect solution

4. **Leave Buffer Time:**
   - Always keep 10 minutes for testing
   - Don't code till the last minute
   - Time for unexpected bugs

## üé® 5. Code Quality & Design Patterns

### **SOLID Principles:**

#### **S - Single Responsibility Principle**
‚ùå **Bad:**
\`\`\`java
class ParkingLot {
    void parkVehicle() { }
    void calculatePrice() { }
    void sendNotification() { }
    void generateReport() { }
}
\`\`\`

‚úÖ **Good:**
\`\`\`java
class ParkingLot {
    void parkVehicle() { }
}
class PricingService {
    double calculatePrice() { }
}
class NotificationService {
    void sendNotification() { }
}
\`\`\`

#### **O - Open/Closed Principle**
‚úÖ Open for extension, closed for modification
\`\`\`java
interface PricingStrategy {
    double calculate(Ticket ticket);
}

class HourlyPricing implements PricingStrategy {
    double calculate(Ticket ticket) { }
}

class FlatRatePricing implements PricingStrategy {
    double calculate(Ticket ticket) { }
}
\`\`\`

---

### **Essential Design Patterns:**

#### **1. Singleton Pattern**
**When to use:** Single instance needed (ParkingLotManager, Database connection)

\`\`\`java
class ParkingLot {
    private static ParkingLot instance;

    private ParkingLot() { }

    public static ParkingLot getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new ParkingLot();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### **2. Factory Pattern**
**When to use:** Creating different types of objects

\`\`\`java
class VehicleFactory {
    public static Vehicle createVehicle(VehicleType type, String number) {
        switch(type) {
            case CAR: return new Car(number);
            case BIKE: return new Bike(number);
            case TRUCK: return new Truck(number);
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### **3. Strategy Pattern**
**When to use:** Multiple algorithms/strategies

\`\`\`java
interface ParkingStrategy {
    ParkingSpot findSpot(VehicleType type);
}

class NearestSpotStrategy implements ParkingStrategy { }
class RandomSpotStrategy implements ParkingStrategy { }
\`\`\`

#### **4. Observer Pattern**
**When to use:** Event notifications

\`\`\`java
interface ParkingObserver {
    void onParkingFull();
    void onSpotAvailable();
}

class ParkingLot {
    List<ParkingObserver> observers;
    void notifyObservers() { }
}
\`\`\`

---

### **Clean Code Practices:**

#### **1. Meaningful Names**
‚ùå Bad: \`ps, v, t\`
‚úÖ Good: \`parkingSpot, vehicle, ticket\`

#### **2. Small Functions**
- Each function does ONE thing
- Max 20-30 lines per function

#### **3. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**
- Extract common code to methods
- Avoid copy-paste

#### **4. Comments Only When Needed**
\`\`\`java
// ‚ùå Bad: Obvious comment
// This method parks a vehicle
void parkVehicle() { }

// ‚úÖ Good: Explains WHY
// Using synchronized to handle concurrent parking requests
synchronized void parkVehicle() { }
\`\`\`

#### **5. Handle Errors Gracefully**
\`\`\`java
public Ticket parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
    if (vehicle == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Vehicle cannot be null");
    }

    ParkingSpot spot = findAvailableSpot(vehicle.getType());
    if (spot == null) {
        throw new ParkingFullException("No spots available");
    }

    // Park the vehicle
}
\`\`\`
