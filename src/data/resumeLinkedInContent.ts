---

## ATS Optimization

**What is ATS?**
Applicant Tracking System - software that scans resumes before humans see them.

**How to Pass ATS:**

1. **Use Standard Section Headers**
   - "Work Experience" not "Where I've Worked"
   - "Education" not "Academic Background"

2. **Use Keywords from Job Description**
   - Match exact terminology
   - Include both acronyms and full forms (ML and Machine Learning)

3. **Avoid:**
   - Images and graphics
   - Tables and text boxes
   - Headers and footers
   - Unusual fonts or formatting

4. **File Format:**
   - Save as .docx or .pdf (check job posting preference)
   - Name file professionally: FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf

---

## Action Verbs to Use

**Instead of "Responsible for":**
- Developed, Created, Built, Designed
- Implemented, Integrated, Configured
- Optimized, Enhanced, Improved
- Collaborated, Coordinated, Led
- Analyzed, Researched, Investigated
- Automated, Streamlined, Simplified
- Achieved, Delivered, Accomplished

---

## Resume Formatting Best Practices

### Visual Design

**Do:**
- ✅ Use clean, professional fonts (Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman)
- ✅ Font size: 10-12pt for body, 14-16pt for name
- ✅ Consistent formatting throughout

- ✅ Use bullet points for readability
- ✅ Bold section headers
- ✅ Keep it to 1 page for freshers (2 pages for experienced)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Use decorative or hard-to-read fonts
- ❌ Use colors excessively (stick to black/dark gray)
- ❌ Cram too much information
- ❌ Use tables or text boxes (ATS may not read them)
- ❌ Include graphics or charts

---

- ❌ Lying or exaggerating skills
